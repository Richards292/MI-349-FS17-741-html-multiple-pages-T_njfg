    <p align="middle">This card is yet another one considered at the top of the game. It's purpose is simply to put one player ahead of another in the "mana curve"</p>

    <p align="middle">Every turn, a player will have access to a "mana supply". The first turn allows the player 1 mana, the second turn 2 mana, up to 10 mana. Cards have a mana cost. This means on turn 1, you can only play cards of 1 mana cost, etc. This serves to limit what cards you can play, and prevents you from playing strong cards too early.</p>

    <p align="middle">A common strategy is to try to gain mana faster than usual. Some cards will say "gain a mana crystal". This means rather than moving from 1 mana to 2 mana, like usual, they might move from 1 mana to 3 mana. While their opponent is doing the usual 1 to 2. This provides the player with a significant advantage.</p>
